# Tesla-Stock-Prediction-Using-LSTM

Welcome to the Tesla Stock Prediction project! This repository contains code for predicting Tesla stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Dive into the world of stock market forecasting and explore the exciting possibilities with this beginner-friendly project.

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting future stock prices for Tesla by employing LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in data. With the provided code, you can understand the basics of time series prediction and apply it to forecast Tesla's stock prices.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

# Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open and run the Tesla_Stock_Prediction.ipynb notebook. This will guide you through the entire process of loading data, preparing it for the LSTM model, training the model, and making predictions.

# Folder Structure:-
data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
